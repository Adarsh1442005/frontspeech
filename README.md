# TECHNOLOGIES USED :

- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **AssemblyAI**: Speech-to-text transcription API.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database to store and manage transcriptions.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For fast and consistent styling.

# INSTALLATION AND SETUP :

- As normally the text-editor using which we write the codes is basically **vscode**.

- As this a **Full Mern-Stack** based application programm so for integrating purpose we have installed the **react** for frontend part **user-interface** and **node.js** for backend service

- For sending the request from frontend to the backend ,this app use the **axios** a powerfull **javascript** library whose functionality is to process all kinds of web request **POST , GET , PUT , DELETE**.

- For transcription purpose we have used the **Assembly_AI** ,At the time of login it provided us the **Api-key** that we used on the backend side for the transcription purpose.

-For version control purpose we have used **GitHub** where we have integrated the remote repository named as **frontspeech** as frontend part and **Speech-transcript** for backend part.

## Deployment:

- For deployment first of all we pushed our project on **Github**.
- After that we have created the account on webhosting platform **Render.com**.
- we have created a new Webservice there and deployed our both **frontend and backend** there.
- For the initialization of the frontend service we have used the command **npm start** and for backend **node servering.js**.

## HOW TO USE IT:

-**May be the app take some time for opening the pages first time so please will wait for some time**
-Firstly when will we visit the url **https://frontspeech-1.onrender.com** we will obtain the home page.

-May be possible it will take some time for loading once so please wait there.

-when will we reach out to the home there we found some options for rendering on differnt parts of application such as
**Login, Logout, Signin, signup , Getstarted**.

-whenever will you want to open the main page where we can upload the audio-files for the transcription purpose we should have visit with the **GetStarted** .

- But if without **Login** yourself you will try to reach out there you can'nt be able to do so.

-there is a need to **login** yourself by creating your account first.

**on signin page after entering all details click on signin button and try to stay there for a moment if it will take time**

-If your credentials exist in the database then you will found on the same page on bottom with the green text that
**you have loogedin successfully** otherwise with red text **given username or password not exists**

-once you have loggedin yourself then you can go the the transcription page by clicking on the **getstarted** on home page.

-may be **getstarted** take sometime but it will open definitely.

**We re open to enhancing this furtherâ€”get in touch if you have ideas for new features!**
